# Weather deliverer

This is my mobile application made in process of getting familirized with React Native.
Based on [Emma Williams'](https://github.com/Em01/weather-app-demo) tutorial. Original touches:

- TypeScript
- Expo navigation
- Usage of context
- Own basic styling

## Expo run

1. `npm install` - install dependencies
2. `npx expo start` - start the application in expo

Developed on [Android Studio emulator](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator)
